I successfully completed several critical milestones outlined in the DevOps roadmap, including, Implementing automated workflows to reduce manual interventions and streamline operations y using azure devops jobs. Facilitating improved collaboration between development and operations teams, fostering a culture of shared responsibility. I am eager to continue building on this momentum, further refining our DevOps maturity journey, and achieving measurable outcomes that benefit both our teams and the organization as a whole.


I dedicated personal time to mastering Kubernetes and Docker, focusing on building a solid foundation in containerization and orchestration. I have been actively exploring and benchmarking Kubernetes best practices against Cloud Security Maturity (CSM) standards. My knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker, and CSM benchmarks positions me to drive initiatives that improve operational efficiency and reduce time-to-market for future projects.I aim to bring tangible benefits to our teams and the organization as a whole. I look forward to leveraging this expertise to drive innovation and operational excellence in our cloud-native initiatives.

 I successfully implemented comprehensive branch protection policies in our GitHub enterprise. Also Configured branch protection rules to ensure that only authorized team members can make modifications to critical branches.These policies have significantly reduced the likelihood of errors or vulnerabilities entering production environments. It lays a strong foundation for scaling our development processes while maintaining robust governance over our codebase.I will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these branch protection policies and gather feedback to make iterative improvements. 


Implemented and enforced MFA across all user accounts on GitHub, adding an essential layer of security to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access.Conducted rigorous testing of SSO integration with GitHub, validating its functionality and ensuring seamless access for authorized users while maintaining robust security standards.Addressed and resolved potential integration challenges, paving the way for efficient and secure identity and access management.

Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of open-source solutions for performance monitoring, log aggregation, automated testing, and infrastructure provisioning. Enhanced automated testing frameworks to improve test coverage and reduce manual intervention, resulting in higher quality deployments  is under progress mostly we will be done by 1st half of 2025.


Deployed and managed applications using containers using AKS, enabling dynamic provisioning, scaling, and orchestration of workloads to meet fluctuating demands is under discussion and will be very first step in further. Adopted Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using tools like Terraform and ARM templates to define, manage, and automate the underlying infrastructure .
